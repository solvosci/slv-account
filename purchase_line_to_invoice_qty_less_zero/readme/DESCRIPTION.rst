When a purchase order has a line that has been invoiced more than expected,
Odoo keeps "to invoice" status, because a refund invoice is usually required.

With this addon a purchase line that has more quantity invoiced than expected
has the same behavior than those exactly invoiced, no need to refund invoices
to obtain fully invoiced status.
